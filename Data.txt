	In order to find the comparisons/dissimilarities, I will be using the Toronto and Manhatten neighborhood breakdown. Using the latitude/longitude values, I will find an appropriate number of business within an appropriate distance from the center lat/long of the neighborhood. This will be done for both Toronto and Manhatten.
	The data will then be stripped of the latitude and longitude numbers so that all neighborhoods in both cities are treated as neighborhoods in one city.
	The data will be run through a k-means algorithm to find the clusters of similar neighborhoods. An appropriate value of k will be determined based on the results in order to get all three distinct categories: at least one cluster that contains neighborhoods from both cities, at least one cluster containing only neighborhoods in Toronto, and at least one cluster containing only neighborhoods in Manhatten.
